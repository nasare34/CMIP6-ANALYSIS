# CMIP6-ANALYSIS


	Investigate the potential impacts of climate change using either [Artificial Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron or Support Vector approaches]based on three CMIP6 (SSP 1-2.6, SSP2−4.5 and SSP5−8.5) scenarios.
	The results should show the precipitation and temperature changes in the region. Thus, either they have shown an increasing or decreasing trend under the SSP 1-2.6, SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 scenarios. [Thus compared results to each other (PCP1 vrs PCP2 vrs PCP5 as well as TEMP1 vrs TEMP2 vrs TEMP5)].
	With the 35-year period (1980–2014) chosen as the reference period, what are the precipitation and temperature (maximum & minimum) changes for the three future periods: near future (2015–2043), mid-far future (2044 – 2072) and far future (2073–2100).
